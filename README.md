<div align="center"> Miracle Musical is a side project created by Joe Hawley of the Michigan based band Tally Hall. Hawley collaborated on this side project with fellow Tally Hall members Rob Cantor, Zubin Sedghi, and Ross Federman. The album is highly experimental in nature and is somewhat of a departure from the band's usual music. Miracle Musical has only even released one album, that album being Hawaii: Part II.
