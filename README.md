<div align="left"> Miracle Musical is a side project created by Joe Hawley of the Michigan based band Tally Hall. Hawley collaborated on this side project with fellow Tally Hall members Rob Cantor, Zubin Sedghi, and Ross Federman. Miracle Musical has only even released one album, that album being Hawaii: Part II.

The album is highly experimental in nature and is somewhat of a departure from the band's usual music. Despite having been released in 2012, Hawaii: Part II is still quite popular and there is still a somewhat active fanbase for Miracle Musical and Tally Hall despite them having been on hiatus since 2019, with Tally Hall's last release being the single Just A Friend in 2019, and Miracle Musical's last release being the single Variations on a Cloud in 2012. However, it is speculated that the band will return as Joe Hawley's website and the band's twitter has been more active as of late.
