Hawley collaborated on this side project with fellow Tally Hall members Rob Cantor, Zubin Sedghi, and Ross Federman.

The album is highly experimental in nature and is somewhat of a departure from the band's usual music. Despite having been released in 2012, Hawaii: Part II is still quite popular and there is still a somewhat active fanbase for Miracle Musical and Tally Hall despite them having been on hiatus since 2019, with Tally Hall's last release being the single Just A Friend in 2019, and Miracle Musical's last release being the single Variations on a Cloud in 2012. However, it is speculated that the band will return as Joe Hawley's website and the band's twitter has been more active as of late.

  <h1> The Content of Hawaii: Part II </h1>
<p align="center">
The songs on Hawaii: Part II all have very unique songs and leitmotifs. The first song on the album, Introduction to the Snow is very lighthearted with a joyful piano accompanied by sleighbells which are reminicsient of the holiday season and the "snow" mentioned in the title. Another song by the name of The Mind Electric features a first half that avid listeners will recognize to be the second half reversed. This song sounds darker than Introduction to the Snow and features heavy vocal distortion. The album doesn't have a confirmed story but fans of the project have pieced together the lyrics of the songs. The most widely accepted theory is that of a man who has visited Hawaii and fallen in love with a girl. After being framed for her murder, he pleads insane and is subjected to electroshock therapy and actually goes insane. He is then lured out into the ocean by "sirens" and drowns to death.

<blockquote>

In some effortless place <br> 
Bound by delicate dread <br> 
Saving no face <br> 
Air dissolves <br>
Where one game is designed <br> 
Something's elegant find <br> 
So the program goes <br>
  </blockquote>
These lyrics are interpreted to be the beginning of the protagonist's love story and describe the uncontrollable feeling of love and how it can make you feel as if you're floating on air, or in an "effortless place".
Lyrics like:
> I was in the middle ground <br>
> Looking to find the fountain of infinite mirror <br>
> Tree falling, no one would hear <br> 
> Shadow of nobody there <br>
> Murders of murderers living in fear of it <br> 
Describe the point of view of an outsider who witnesses the murder of the protagonist's love interest but
