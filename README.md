<div align="left"> Miracle Musical is a side project created by Joe Hawley of the Michigan based band Tally Hall. Hawley collaborated on this side project with fellow Tally Hall members Rob Cantor, Zubin Sedghi, and Ross Federman. Miracle Musical has only ever released one album, that album being Hawaii: Part II.

The album is highly experimental in nature and is somewhat of a departure from the band's usual music. Despite having been released in 2012, Hawaii: Part II is still quite popular and there is still a somewhat active fanbase for Miracle Musical and Tally Hall despite them having been on hiatus since 2019, with Tally Hall's last release being the single Just A Friend in 2019, and Miracle Musical's last release being the single Variations on a Cloud in 2012. However, it is speculated that the band will return as Joe Hawley's website and the band's twitter has been more active as of late.

# The Content of Hawaii: Part II
<p align="center">
The songs on Hawaii: Part II all have very unique songs and leitmotifs. The first song on the album, Introduction to the Snow is very lighthearted with a joyful piano accompanied by sleighbells which are reminicsient of the holiday season and the "snow" mentioned in the title. Another song by the name of The Mind Electric features a first half that avid listeners will recognize to be the second half reversed. This song sounds darker than Introduction to the Snow and features heavy vocal distortion. The album doesn't have a confirmed story but fans of the project have pieced together the lyrics of the songs. The most widely accepted theory is that of a man who has visited Hawaii and fallen in love with a girl. After being framed for her murder, he pleads insane and is subjected to electroshock therapy and actually goes insane. He is then lured out into the ocean by "sirens" and drowns to death.

Fans think that the story is related to the love story, framing, and drowning of the main character because of lyrics like:

> Drift aloft
> In some effortless place
> Bound by delicate dread
> Saving no face
> Air dissolves
> Where one game is designed
> Something's elegant find
> So the program goes
